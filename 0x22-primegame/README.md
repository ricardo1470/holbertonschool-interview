| [0. Prime Game](./0-prime_game.py) | Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game. They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is. |
