| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Minimum Operations](./0-minoperations.py) | there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n H` characters in the file. |
|  |   |

* Example:
    * `n = 9`
    * `H` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HH` => `Paste` => `HHH` => `Copy All` => `Paste` => `HHHHHH` => `Paste` => `HHHHHHHHH`
    * Number of operations: `6`
